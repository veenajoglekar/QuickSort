# QuickSort
1.The name "Quick Sort" comes from the fact that, quick sort is capable of sorting a list of data elements 
  significantly faster (twice or thrice faster) than any of the common sorting algorithms.
  
2. QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

3.Technically, quick sort follows the below steps:
    Step 1 − Make any element as pivot
    Step 2 − Partition the array on the basis of pivot
    Step 3 − Apply quick sort on left partition recursively
    Step 4 − Apply quick sort on right partition recursively
